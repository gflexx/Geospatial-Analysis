= first map exercise:
This project explores Kiva loan distribution in the Philippines using geospatial analysis. 
Kiva works with local "Field Partners" to reach remote borrowers. The goal is to identify underserved regions 
that may fall outside Kiva's current partner networkâ€”highlighting opportunities to expand 
their reach and recruit new Field Partners.
